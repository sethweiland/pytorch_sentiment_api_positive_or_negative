# pytorch sentiment api positive or negative
&nbsp;
### Note: Almost all of the pytorch sentiment model code was taken from @github.com/bentrevett ... This project was mainly an excercise in deploying a pytorch model as REST api, however I also learned a fair amount about preparing text data for NLP modeling with PyTorch and all the components (iterators, optimizer, criterion, model classes, etc.) needed to train a PyTorch model.
